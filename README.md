# CodePath iOS Prework

## App Description
This app has an input field, text, and several buttons. The user can enter text into the input field, then tap "Change Text String" to change the text to what the user entered into that field. The user can also tap the "Change Background Color" button to change the background color of the app, or the "Change Text Color" button to change the text color on the screen. The user can also tap the "Reset" button to reset the text and colors to their initial states.

## Other Information
This app took about 3 hours to develop. I watched Youtube Videos to figure out how to connect code to the buttons and text on the screen. I used a function from Stack Overflow for producing a random color for the text and background color upon the user pressing those respective functions.
